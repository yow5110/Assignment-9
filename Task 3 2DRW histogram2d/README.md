# Week 11 Task 3

Here's a treat! We are going to make a 2D histogram similar to Chapter 6.3.2 in the textbook, rendered in 3D. 

The actual code is a bit involved so everything is provided. You'll just need to stitch it with your 2D random walk model to see the results and tinker with it. Make sure you're using the Automatic graphics backend to be able to interact with the 3D plot by dragging. You should see a 2D Gaussian shape with a peak at the center, consistent with the scatter plot in Task 2. A sample image is attached as "sample-original".

Try to find which parameter controls the thickness of the bars and make the bars thinner like in "sample-expected.png".

When in doubt, you can refer to the official manual:
